// A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange 
// order: all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon as possible. There will
// be a flight out at 8:00 pm every evening. Each person can see everyone else's eye
// color, but they do not know their own(nor is anyone allowed to tell them). 
// Additionally, they do not know how many people have blue eues, although they do
// know that at least one person does. How many days will it take the blue-eyed people
// to leave?

// ------------------------------------ my solution ----------------------------------

// I have trouble in understanding this problem ...
// 题目实在理解不了

// ----------------------------------- original solution -----------------------------

// Assume that there are n people on the island and c of them have blue eyes. We are
// explicitly told that c > 0.

// Case c = 1: Exactly one person has blue eyes.
// Since the blue-eyed man knows that everyone else has no blue eyes, he can conclude
// that it is he who has blue eyes. Therefore, he will leave that night.

// Case c = 2: Exactly two people have blue eyes.
// From the previous case, that if c = 1, the blue-eyed person would leave on the 
// first night. Therefore, if the other blue-eyed person is still there, he must
// deduce that c = 2, which means that he himself has blue eyes. Both men would leave
// on the second night.

// Case c > 2: The eneral case
// If c = 3, then those three people will immediately know that there are either 2 or
// 3 people with blue eyes. If there were two people, then those two people would have
// left on the second night. So when the others are still around after that night, 
// each person would conclude that c = 3 and that they, therefore, have blue eyes too.

// We can see the logic continues to apply. If c men have blue eyes, it will take c 
// nights for the blue-eyed men to leave. All will leave on the same night.
