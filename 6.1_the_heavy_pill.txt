// You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of 
// weight 1.1 gram. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you
// find the heavy bottle?

// ----------------------------------- my solution -----------------------------------

// Here's what I thought:
// It seems like the 'Nine balls problem', but it's not actually, cause it provides
// exact weight of bottles. Also the description mentions "a exact measurement". So
// there must ba a quantity relationship bewtween pills.

// ... I totally have no idea.

// --------------------------------- original solution -------------------------------

// I think I mistaken the question. It says "have 1.0 gram pills", which means
// every pill weights 1.0 grams. But I thought that 1 bottle weights 1.0 grams.

// We can generalize this to the full solution: take one pill from Bottle #1, two
// pills from Bottle #2, three pills from Bottle #3, and so on. Weight all of these
// pills. If all pills were one gram each, the scale would read 210 grams(1+2+...+20)
// Any "overage" must come from the extra 0.1 gram pills.
// The formula:  (weight - 210 grams) / 0.1 grams
// We can just calculate the number according to this formula.

// And another thought: The question mentions these are pills, it's seperatable, so 
// it could be important. Also, confirm that there're enough pills to be taken out.
