// In the new post-apocalyptic world, the world queen is desperately concerned about
// the birth rate. Therefore, she decrees that all families should ensure that they
// have one girl or else they face massive fines. If all families abide by this policy
// - that is, they have continue to have children untill they have one girl, at which
// point they immediately stop - what will the gender ratio of the new generation be?
// (Assume that the odds of someone having a boy or a girl on any given pregnancy is
// equal.) Solve this our logically and then write a computer simulation of it.

// ------------------------------------ my solution ----------------------------------

// The policy assures that every family has only one girl and unknown number of boys.
// That reminds me that "one child policy" in China, especially in countryside, where
// the number of girls surpassses that of boys. So the ratio of girls to boys would 
// less than 0.5. But I can't get more specific figure.

// Computer simulation would be like this:
// void oneGirlFamily(families) {
//     for (family : families in the world) {
//         do {
//	           child = giveBirth();
//         } while (child != girl)
//      }
// }


// ----------------------------------- original solution -----------------------------

// PS: Actually, if I think throughly, this problem is not that difficult.

// Mathmatically:
// P (G) = 1/2
// P (BG) = 1/4
// P (BBG) = 1/8
// P (B...G) = ...
// The probability of have a girl will be the sum of those p. Since it's a geometric
// series, the sum is (a1*(1-q^n)/(1-q)) which equal to 1-1/2^n. When n -> infinite
// the result will be closer to 1.
// Logically:
// If the earlier sum is 1, this would mean that the gender radio is even. Families
// contribute exactly one girl and on average one boy. The birth policy is therefore
// ineffective. That contradicts to our common sense.
// One way to think about is to imagine that we put all the gender sequence of each 
// family into one giant string. So if family1 has BG, family2 has BBG, family2 has G,
// we would write BGBBGG, it's even between B and G.

// Simulation
// double runNFamilies(int n) {
	int boys = 0;
	int girls = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int[] genders = runOneFamily();
		girls += genders[0];  // [0]是返回女孩数量
		boys += genders[1];   // [1]是返回男孩数量
	}
	return girls / (double) (boys + girls);  // 计算ratio
}

int[] runOneFamily() {
	Random random = new Random();
	int boys = 0;
	int girls = 0;
	while (girls == 0) { // untill we have a girl
		if (rando.nextBoolean()) { // girl
			girls += 1;
		} else {
			boys += 1;
		}
	}
	int[] genders = {girls, boys}; // 一次打包送回girls和boys的数量
	return genders;
