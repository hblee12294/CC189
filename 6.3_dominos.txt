// There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut
// off. You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. 
// Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your anwser (by 
// providing an example or showing why it's impossible).

// ----------------------------------- my solution ----------------------------------

// "Two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off" means 
// "一条对角线上的两个对角被切掉了"
// My anwser is No. It's not possible to cover the whole board, since cornners which 
// are cut off are not adjacent. 
// It's a little complicated to explain. Because two corners are cutted, the best 
// situation is that there're two squares left, which are situated diagonally. 
// Suppose we can fill the chessboard layer by layer from outside. When it comes to
// the next layer, the situation is similar to the last layer, two diagonal 
// corners are missing.

// ----------------------------------- original solution -----------------------------

// A clearner explain.
// The chessboard initially has 32 black and 32 white squares. By removing opposite 
// corners (which must be the same color), we're left with 30 of one color and 32 of
// the other color. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that we have 30 black and
// 32 white squares.
// Each domino we set on the board will always take up one white and one black square.
//Therefore, 31 dominos will take up 31 white squares and 31 black squares exactly.
// On this board, however, we must have 30 black squares and 32 white squares. Hence
// it is impossible.
